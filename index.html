    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Amy, and I am a junior stuying mathematics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
        I was born in Lagos, Nigeria and moved to the US to study maths in 2016. I started out as a civil engineer,
        before realizing that I wanted to spend my time doing as much math as possible. My current interests are in math modeling,
        probability theory, and finding ways to simulate biological and environmental problems using mathematical methods.

        In my free time, I like to crochet, cook, and read about the history of various aspects of our society. I also like cats and road trips!
